The :hover css pseudo class effect: How it works in mobile with this library?
Create the .hover class in your stylesheet file, to simulate the :hover effect. All you have to do is repeat the content of this pseudo class to the .hover class.
Example:

	button:hover{
		background-color: red;
	}

  All you have to do is create a new class like this:

	button.hover{
		background-color: red;
	}
